## First questions where is the hashtag on my keyboard?
It's utterly ridiculous isn't it the things that slow you down, or stop you making progress. In a hurtle to sort out the new version of my blog I am utilising my favourite anxiety management strategy...  It's a head down and botch it strategy.

Now obviously this isn't how I finish whatever it is that is making me squeam, but it is a good way to start...  Don't think, just do...  Keep going until the screaming voice of fear is deafening.

When you've got a page then go back and read it...

## Second question? Why isn't there a second question? 
After all that would justify the usage of H2, which is the thing I am playing with when faffing about with ****Markdown**** in [prose](prose.io "Link to Prose site for writing blog posts.")
